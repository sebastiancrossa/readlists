# Kuration

Like choosing songs to listen to, 
finding books to read can be hard. Kuration recommends “readlists” 
that carry books grouped by different topics and learnings so that
readers can spend less time browsing, and more time reading!


You can see the website in action at [Kuration.tech](https://www.kuration.tech).
